    shape: "narrow conical",
    origin: "West coast of USA (from Oregon to California",
    description:" This tree loves oceanic climate, with mild winters and cool summers. It prefers to grow sheltered from direct sun. In city parks it can only grow half as tall compared to the native environment. The hard, resistant wood is often used for critical building uses. Also known as Port Orford Cedar",

    origin: "Northeast of North America",
    description:"The Tuliptree (Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee State tree), called after the shape of the blossoms, is a very ancient species. It is drought-intolerant.

    shape: "narrow conical",
    origin: "Eastern Australia",
    description:" The Silky Oak (also known as Australian, Silver-oak) grows fast when young but considerably slows down also in subtropical and dry forests, as it can withstand drought. It is a frost-intolerant species, so it needs protection when planted young. The wood is much appreciated for the building of musical instruments, particularly guitars. It used to be common also for external window joinery before the advent of aluminium",

    description:
    'Kanuka was mainly known as Manuka until the 1930s. It is a New Zealand native species that is often erroneously confused with Australia’s Burgan, which grows mostly as a shrub, while New Zealand’s Kanuka can reach the respectable height of 30 meters and a trunk diameter of 1 meter. It is a very competitive species that often prevails over the others in the open forests. It often recolonizes wasted lands. The white blooming is visually remarkable.'

In city parks, it is often planted near lakes.'

The venerable existing species of the Oriental Planetree can reach an impressive size and shape.'

The Great Banyan, located near Kolkata, India, is over 200 years old, covers over two acres and has hundreds of trunks. The Banyan is also considered sacred in India, and can often be found by temples.'

    'Also known as Wild Gum or Ribbon Gum, this tree is widely distributed in the cooler South-eastern regions of Australia, and in Tasmania as well. The leaves are one of the favorites of Koalas. The high sugar content of the sap makes the trunk also a food source for tree dwelling marsupial mammals. The timber is easily workable but has low durability. The tallest known exemplar is in Tasmania and reaches the unusual impressive height of 89 m.'

    description:
    'Koa is one of the fastest growing Hawaiian trees, as it can reach 20 feet in five years. However, after that, it takes 50 years to reach a commercially useful dimension, and for this reason it is not often farmed. Ancient Hawaiians used to build their canoes with the trunk of Koa. The reddish wood is today used for musical instruments, like the typical "Ukulele". Grazing has much reduced the Koa population on the Hawaii islands, making the regeneration nearly impossible.'
